hi there,

please do the following to execute this test.

1. change the permissions on the manuel_test.sh to execute (e.g. +x manuel_test.sh)
2. execute manuel_test.sh (e.g. ./manuel_test.sh)
3. look at your streamview window - see how in FILTER_TO_LAZY contains 2 records and not 1 as expected - this shows the bug.
